A plugin to add Google Maps in Dotclear blog posts

This extension allows you to insert Google Maps in your posts. It creates a new entry type named <em>map elements</em>. 
These elements may be points, polylines, polygons, rectangles, circles, GeoRSS feeds or kml layers. 
You may then attach a map to any post and include in it any number of these elements.
